Project Title: Network Analysis of Canadian Wildfires: Investigating Causes

Objective: To investigate the clustering patterns of wildfires in Canada using K-Means Clustering, incorporating geographical features such as longitude, latitude, and distance from water resources, and analyzing relationships with wildfire causes and sizes. The study also explores how additional variables (e.g., weather conditions, teamperature, wind direction) influence clustering patterns.


Analysis Overview

K-Means Clustering:
K-Means was applied to standardized geographical features (longitude, latitude, distance to water).
Five clusters were identified, representing distinct wildfire groupings.
Geographical Distribution of Clusters:
A geographical plot shows the spatial distribution of the clusters.

Clusters represent varying fire causes and geographic features, such as remote regions versus areas near urban centers.
Cluster Attributes:
Clusters were analyzed based on average fire size, total number of fires, and dominant wildfire causes.
Cause Analysis:
Distribution of wildfire causes across clusters was examined to understand dominant patterns.
Causes were also related to average distances from water sources.

Incorporation of Additional Variables:
Weather conditions, temperature, and wind direction were proposed as additional variables to refine clustering and interpret results.
