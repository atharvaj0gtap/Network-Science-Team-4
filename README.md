Project Title: Network Analysis of Canadian Wildfires: Investigating Causes

Wildfire propagation is a complex and dynamic process influenced by various environmental factors such as wind direction, topography, and vegetation. Traditional models often struggle to capture these interdependencies, limiting the effectiveness of emergency response strategies.
Our project proposes using network analysis to model wildfire propagation by treating geographic regions as nodes and critical factors influencing fire spread (e.g., causes, weather) as edges.
